    <h3> Why did I choose to study at <i>LSPU</i>? </h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><strong>
   I picked <em>LSPU</em> above other schools because it is a well-known public institution 
  <br> with expansive grounds and first-rate equipment, as well as a high standard
  <br> of education. It has excellent teachings, so I can easily understand assignments 
  <br> and lectures. This campus embodies diversity in its programs, clubs, 
  <br> and extracurriculars, and most importantly, in its people. I think diversity 
  <br> is important in all aspects of learning. By being exposed to this wide range
  <br> of different experiences and perspectives, I hope to become a well-rounded
  <br> person and future. In addition, Iâ€™m excited to take advantage of
  <br> more opportunities that this university will offer.

   <h4> Why did I choose to be part of <i>CCS</i>? </h4>
   <br>
   <br>
    <p><strong>   
   I chose <em>CCS</em> because I am always fascinated by how technology works and how it will
   <br> change my life. With the capability of computers as well as the seemingly limitless
   <br> opportunities that <em>CCS</em> presents, I'm eager to learn how to invest in innovation to 
   <br> develop original solutions to significant challenges. <em>CCS</em> provides us the opportunity
   <br> to study at a world-class institution that not only gives you the knowledge to become 
   <br> a great artist or designer but also the experience to prove it through your work. 
   <br> <em>CCS</em> offers great opportunities for true creativity and innovativeness.
